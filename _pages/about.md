Hi! I'm Guohao, a Computing and Information Science Ph.D. student studying Maching Learning in the [School of Information](https://www.rit.edu/computing/school-of-information) at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), advised by [Zhiqiang Tao](https://ztao.cc/).
My research primarily centers on data-centric approaches for vision-language models, emphasizing the understanding of robust general vision-language understanding and adaptation to downstream tasks. This includes uncertainty, reinforcement learning, and elimination of hallucination to enhance the robustness of deep generative model.



My research
======

I am drawn to simplicity, strive to understand things deeply, and enjoy building practical systems.
Currently, I am fascinated by foundation models like GPT-4, CLIP, and DALL-E. These models, trained on extensive data using self-supervision at an immense scale, can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks. Foundation models represent a paradigm shift in AI development and human-AI interaction. My focus is on understanding how these models work, and improving their intelligence and robustness with multi-modal information.




My background and history
======
I received my B.S. from the [College of Engineering](https://engineering.msu.edu/about/departments/ece) at Michigan State University in 2018, and M.S. from the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/academic-programs/department-of-computer-engineering/graduate/) at Santa Clara University in 2021. Between my undergraduate and graduate studies, I was a SDE at [Robotrak](https://www.robotrak.cn/#/home/zh), focusing on traditional and Machine Learning algorithm design and implementation.
